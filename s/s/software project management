Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile: Flexible and iterative, allowing for changes during development. Good for projects with evolving requirements. However, it can be difficult to predict timelines and costs.
Waterfall: Follows a linear, step-by-step approach. Easier to manage and predict timelines and costs but less flexible when requirements change.
In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile: Works well in projects with rapidly changing requirements, like mobile app development or startups.
Waterfall: More suited for projects with well-defined requirements, like government contracts or large enterprise software.
